            Highly esteemed participants on the behalf of the executive team, We welcome you to the second edition of
            KARMUN.
            This conference is the result of lots of sleepless nights and the resilience of our executives. When we
            started working for this conference, the world was a different place. During the time that we spent
            cultivating this conference from the very scratch, we witnessed a society which was being shaped by various
            events both good and bad. As the executives we can say that we had to adapt to the ever changing
            circumstances, in order to put an end to 4 years of waiting. Our dream is to make KARMUN a conference that
            would reflect the breaking points that constructed the world that we are living in. In this years Karmun, we
            crafted 3 Crisis Committees, which will push our delegates' problem
            solving skills to its limit and help them to adapt to every situation that they encounter.
            Our academic team worked meticulously in order to craft 3 special committees which will broden our
            delegates horizon and help them towards being one step closer to their academic goals. As KARMUN Team, our
            sole aim is to cultivate a conference in which our delegates creative ideas will find voice. As executives
            we hope that during 3 days you are going to be spending, debating, writing and changing the world through
            your pen and ideas, you will find a piece of yourself in this conference and connect with the like minded
            individuals. Because we reckon that the change comes from unity when we stand together as one we will have
            the power towards making our world a better place for everyone regardless of their race, religion or
            backgrounds.

            Esteemed participants of KARMUN'23, it is an honor for me to welcome you to the second edition of KARMUN.
            Even though I can not entirely explain how much we have worked on KARMUN'23 and show my gratitude towards
            the people who have worked on it with this letter, I will try my best. This was probably one of the biggest
            journeys that was ever taken by the KARMUN family as we had a lot of obstacles throughout it, but
            fortunately, we have overcome every one of them with our passion. KARMUN family was waiting for a miracle to
            happen, a long gone tradition was waited for it to be born from it's ashes. The long waited miracle has
            become a reality, and now, we are here with KARMUN'23. I would like to express my gratitute towards every
            individual who worked on KARMUN'23 for it to be a reality.
